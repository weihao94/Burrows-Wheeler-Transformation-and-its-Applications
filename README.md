# Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation-and-its-Applications

National University of Singapore, Department of Mathematics

May 2017 â€“ Jul 2017

Project description:

Module: MA3288 Advanced UROPS in Mathematics I

Supervisor: Professor Zhang Louxin

Objective: The project is to understand the combinatorial properties of the Burrows-Wheeler transformation, discuss its connection to de Bruijn sequences, and to evaluate its performance in text compression

Methods/Techniques: Implement the transformation in Python and test it on real data and simulated binary data

Relevance: Big data storage

Fields of research: Combinatorics and Graph Theory
